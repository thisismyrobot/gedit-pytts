An optomistic attempt to extend gedit a bit with some accessabiltiy plug-ins.

(Not that there's anything wrong with gedit, I just want to use it for the ease
of plug-in development in Python :D)

Oh, and gedit works on Linux and Windows. Because I don't take sides :)

Currently dev'ing on Windows with gedit 2.30.1
